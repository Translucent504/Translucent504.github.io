**Currently looking for work related to data science / software development.**

I have a degree in applied physics ~~and I play Dota2.~~ Now I am trying to understand all the hype around AI and Deep Learning. I believe my accumulation of knowledge is pointless if I don't to teach it to others. I would like to be a [distiller](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/) of knowledge.
