# Probability Models:
- A model consists of:
    - A sample space.
    - Probability laws that assign probabilities to elements or groups of elements in the sample space.

## Discrete Uniform Law / Model:
- If a sample space $\Omega$ has $\n$ elements and all of them are equally likely.
- If an event $A$ is a subspace of $\Omega$ and has $k$ elements.
- The probability of event $A$ is $k.\frac{1}{n}$
