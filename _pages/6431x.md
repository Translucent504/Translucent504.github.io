# Probability Models:
- A model consists of:
    - A sample space.
    - Probability laws that assign probabilities to elements or groups of elements in the sample space.

## Axioms and Useful Results:
We use set notation to work with probability.  
- $$P(\Omega)=1$$
- $$P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)$$ for disjoint events A and B.
- $$P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$$ for not necessarily disjoint A and B.

Its a good idea to convert events into a form where we have all disjoint sets which then allows us to use the addition axiom.

## Discrete Uniform Law / Model:
- If a sample space $$\Omega$$ has $$n$$ elements and all of them are equally likely.
- If an event $$A$$ is a subspace of $$\Omega$$ and has $$k$$ elements.
- The probability of event $$A$$ is $$k.\frac{1}{n}$$
