- [ ] Books with hyperlinks to figures in them should have this functionality:
    - Click on figure, it pops up as a hovering figure beside the current text you are reading
    - scrolling through the text that describes it keeps the figure hovering over as you scroll through.
    - this makes the whole reading process smoother since jumping to figure and then scrolling backup to where we were before really breaks the flow of reading.
    - have the figure join its original place when you reach it in text.
- [ ] Memory Palace in Minecraft or something similar.

- [ ] Make some sort of distribution zoo, where you display visually how the distributions commonly encountered by undergrads have their shapes determined like for example the gaussian distribution has its shape determined by only 2 parameters, the position of the center of its peak (the mean) and the width/flatness of the peak (the variance). and show how varying these parameters changes the distribution, this wouldve been so nice in physics with those stupid lorentz/boltzmann and idk what else distributions were being sampled with the Full width half maximum (FWHM) of random ass waves were being taken without knowing what the actual function is being modelled or having any intuition for it.... __FeelsBadMan__
