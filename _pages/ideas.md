- [ ] Books with hyperlinks to figures in them should have this functionality:
    - Click on figure, it pops up as a hovering figure beside the current text you are reading
    - scrolling through the text that describes it keeps the figure hovering over as you scroll through.
    - this makes the whole reading process smoother since jumping to figure and then scrolling backup to where we were before really breaks the flow of reading.
    - have the figure join its original place when you reach it in text.
