## **Problem**: 
Write a program that takes a double $$x$$ and an integer $$y$$ and returns $$x^y$$. Ignore any overflow and underflow.

## **Solution**:
The naive / brute force approach will be to multiply x by itself y times. Which is $$O(2^n)$$ where n is bits needed to represent y.

We can improve on the naive approach by multiplying x by larger values than just $$x$$ itself. We notice that if we simply put a loop where we do $$x = x*x$$. With each iteration we will increase the exponent of $$x$$ by a  power of 2. i.e: $$x^2 , x^4, x^8 , x^16 .... x^{2^n}$$ with each iteration $$n$$. We notice that by doing so we are only limited to visiting the powers of $$x$$ that are a power of 2. However, if we break down $$y$$ into its binary representation, we can see that at each iteration of our loop we are infact looping over the bits of $$y$$. So we can keep a `result` variable in which we only multiply those powers of $$x$$ that correspond to a `1` bit in $$y$$. We can take care of negative $$y$$ by $$x = frac{1}{x}$$ and then with $$y=-y$$ carry on the same way as with positive y. An example makes the algorithm much easier to grasp.

**Example**:
$$
x = -1.3030347 //
y = 7 //
binary(y)= 0111 //
result = 1
$$

- We have the first power of $$x$$ which is $$x$$ itself which corresponds to 0 bit of y i.e $$2^0$$.
- Since the $$0^th$$ bit of $$y$$ is 1 we include this in the result.
- $$result = result*x = x
- Now we calculate the 2nd power of $$x = x*x = x^2$$
- we shift $$y$$ by 1 bit and then see that $$1^{st}$$ bit of $$y$$ is 1 so we include this in the result.
- $$result = result*x = x^3$$
- $$x = x*x = x^4$$
- $$y$$ 2^{nd} bit is 1
- $$result = result*x = x^7$$
- After shifting y we notice that it is 0 now so we stop our loop and output the value of result which is correctly $$x^7$$


```python
def power(x: float, y: int) -> float:
    """Function to calculate x^y"""
    result = 1
    # The idea is that instead of a cache to store the 2 powers of x
    # we instead convert x to its 2 powers and include them into our result as needed
    # based on the binary representation of y.
    # if y is negative then turn x into 1/x and make y positive.
    if y < 0:
        y = -y
        x = 1.0/x
    while y:
        if y & 1:
            result *= x
        x *= x  # x = x*x (x^2) -> (x^4) -> (x^8) -> (x^16)
        y >>= 1
    return result
```
