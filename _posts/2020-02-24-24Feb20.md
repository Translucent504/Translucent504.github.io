In Python we cannot nest normal sets since they are mutable and therefore not hashable objects. To get around this problem we have
`frozenset()` in Python which is an immutable version of the set. This allows us to construct sets of sets. Where we have one mutable parent set() and
it has multiple immutable child frozensets.
