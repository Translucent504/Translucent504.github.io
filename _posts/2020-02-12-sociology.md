### Ibn-i-Khaldoon:
  - Introduced the scientific method to social sciences.
  - Presented Concept of **AL-ASABIYA** in his book **MOKADMA**.
  - Al-Asabiya is the force that unites people.
  - This _Unity_ or _Solidarity_ is based on shared common experiences and emotions. Which means that people with similar experiences tend to form tight groups and stay united.
  - This sense of unity is strong enough to drive people together to form tribes and then societies.
  - Al-Asabiya is strongest when people depend on each other for their livelihood, like in Nomadic tribes.
  - This interdependence and desire to satisfy mutual needs results in **Urbanization** and formation of a **Civilization**.
  - Civilization is just an organized way for people to co-operate since it includes a system of **Justice**. So people dont have to use force with each other to have their needs fulfilled and can instead look to a higher authority.
  - This unity can not only form societies but also overpower the current government. Al-Asabiya is strong enough to be a source of power and authority for tribes.
  - Al-Asabiya can be weakened by **Subjugation**(Slavery) and **Humiliation**.
  - Al-Asabiya also weakens by itself as the tribes enters into luxury.
  - Divided society into **Urban (Hazri)** and **Rural (Badvi)** types.
  - Al-Asabiya is strongest in rural societies since they have to rely on each other for basic life necessities and protection.
  - Al-Asabiya is weak in urban societies where people live in luxury without fear for their life.
  - He also presented a theory for social change. This was also on the basis of Al-Asabiya. As society loses the force of al-Asabiya it becomes disorganized and a different society which has a stronger force of al-Asabiya takes its place.
  - Described 3 principles of social change:
    1. Physical boundary of states should be limited because it is impossible to control large states.
    2. Physical age of a state is 120 years in 3 equal stages of 40 years each.
    3. Rise and fall of nations is in cycles, when one nation falls: another nation rises to replace it.
  - Most famous work **Ilmul-Imran** later turned into **Imraniyat (sociology)**.

### Herbert Spencer:
  - Presented **Evolutionary Theory** or **Laws of Evolution**.
  - Every society evolves from simple -> complex and homogenous -> heterogenous
  - Divided evolution into 2 main categories:
    1. Simplicity to Complexity:
      - Every society evolves in 4 stages.
      - Simple Society is the most basic society with only families.
      - Compound Society is a large number of simple societies that form a **clan society**
      - Doubly Compound Society is a large number of compound societies or clans that come together to form a tribe.
      - Trebly Compound Society tribes join together and form nation states. This is the present stage the world is in.
      - He also Introduced the idea of static and dynamic sociology where statics refers to fixed social structures and institutions while social dynamics deals with continous movement from homogenous to heterogenous society.
    2. Militant to Industrial:
      - Whether a society is militant or industrial is determined by its relation to other societies. The trend is to evolve from militant to industrial societies.
      - Military societies have compulsory cooperation, Industrial societies have voluntary cooperation.
      - Military societies have a centralized government, Industrial societies have decentralized governments.
      - Military societies have economic autonomy. Industrial societies rely on each other economically.
      - In Military societies the state dominates over all organizations. Industrial societies have a very limited role played by the state.
  - Spencer also presented **Organic Analogy**. Where he considered the human society to be a single biological organism.
  - Following his organic analogy spencer considered various parts of society like state and economy to be like organs in the human body (heart/lungs/kidneys) which work interdependently and are necessary for the whole organism to function properly.
  - He further took ideas from biology and supported **Social Darwinism** which is basically Charles Darwin's theory of evolution from nature applied to sociology.
  - Social Darwinism is based on 2 principles:
    1. Survival of the Fittest:
      - Spencer believed that nature automatically eliminates the weak parts. He believed that the weak parts of the human society like poor people, disabled people, dumb / stupid people should not be supported and instead they should be left to die since they are less fit and it is natural for them to be eliminated so that the stronger parts of the human society survive and this will make the human society evolve into something stronger.
    2. Principle of Non-interference:
      - Spencer believed that the job of the state was to prevent any external entities from interfering the matters of its society.
      - He stated that the state should not waste money on education and taking care of the poor. Instead the state should target its resources into ensuring that rights of individuals are protected.
      - Spencer argued that no one should interfere in the natural process of selection in society and that nature is more intelligent than man.
      - His ideal society had individuals pursuing their interests without being hindered by the state in anyway.
