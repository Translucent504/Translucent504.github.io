### Ibn-i-Khaldoon:
  - Introduced the scientific method to social sciences.
  - Presented Concept of **AL-ASABIYA** in his book **MOKADMA**.
  - Al-Asabiya is the force that unites people.
  - This _Unity_ or _Solidarity_ is based on shared common experiences and emotions. Which means that people with similar experiences tend to form tight groups and stay united.
  - This sense of unity is strong enough to drive people together to form tribes and then societies.
  - Al-Asabiya is strongest when people depend on each other for their livelihood, like in Nomadic tribes.
  - This interdependence and desire to satisfy mutual needs results in **Urbanization** and formation of a **Civilization**.
  - Civilization is just an organized way for people to co-operate since it includes a system of **Justice**. So people dont have to use force with each other to have their needs fulfilled and can instead look to a higher authority.
  - This unity can not only form societies but also overpower the current government. Al-Asabiya is strong enough to be a source of power and authority for tribes.
  - Al-Asabiya can be weakened by **Subjugation**(Slavery) and **Humiliation**.
  - Al-Asabiya also weakens by itself as the tribes enters into luxury.
