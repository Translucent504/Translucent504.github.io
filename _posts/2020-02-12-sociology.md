## Ibn-i-Khaldoon:
  - Introduced the scientific method to social sciences.
  - Presented Concept of **AL-ASABIYA** in his book **MOKADMA**.
  - Al-Asabiya is the force that unites people.
  - This _Unity_ or _Solidarity_ is based on shared common experiences and emotions. Which means that people with similar experiences tend to form tight groups and stay united.
  - This sense of unity is strong enough to drive people together to form tribes and then societies.
  - Al-Asabiya is strongest when people depend on each other for their livelihood, like in Nomadic tribes.
  - This interdependence and desire to satisfy mutual needs results in **Urbanization** and formation of a **Civilization**.
  - Civilization is just an organized way for people to co-operate since it includes a system of **Justice**. So people dont have to use force with each other to have their needs fulfilled and can instead look to a higher authority.
  - This unity can not only form societies but also overpower the current government. Al-Asabiya is strong enough to be a source of power and authority for tribes.
  - Al-Asabiya can be weakened by **Subjugation**(Slavery) and **Humiliation**.
  - Al-Asabiya also weakens by itself as the tribes enters into luxury.
  - Divided society into **Urban (Hazri)** and **Rural (Badvi)** types.
  - Al-Asabiya is strongest in rural societies since they have to rely on each other for basic life necessities and protection.
  - Al-Asabiya is weak in urban societies where people live in luxury without fear for their life.
  - He also presented a theory for social change. This was also on the basis of Al-Asabiya. As society loses the force of al-Asabiya it becomes disorganized and a different society which has a stronger force of al-Asabiya takes its place.
  - Described 3 principles of social change:
    1. Physical boundary of states should be limited because it is impossible to control large states.
    2. Physical age of a state is 120 years in 3 equal stages of 40 years each.
    3. Rise and fall of nations is in cycles, when one nation falls: another nation rises to replace it.
  - Most famous work **Ilmul-Imran** later turned into **Imraniyat (sociology)**.

## Herbert Spencer:
  - Presented **Evolutionary Theory** or **Laws of Evolution**.
  - Every society evolves from simple -> complex and homogenous -> heterogenous
  - Divided evolution into 2 main categories:
    1. Simplicity to Complexity:
      - Every society evolves in 4 stages.
      - Simple Society is the most basic society with only families.
      - Compound Society is a large number of simple societies that form a **clan society**
      - Doubly Compound Society is a large number of compound societies or clans that come together to form a tribe.
      - Trebly Compound Society tribes join together and form nation states. This is the present stage the world is in.
      - He also Introduced the idea of static and dynamic sociology where statics refers to fixed social structures and institutions while social dynamics deals with continous movement from homogenous to heterogenous society.
    2. Militant to Industrial:
      - Whether a society is militant or industrial is determined by its relation to other societies. The trend is to evolve from militant to industrial societies.
      - Military societies have compulsory cooperation, Industrial societies have voluntary cooperation.
      - Military societies have a centralized government, Industrial societies have decentralized governments.
      - Military societies have economic autonomy. Industrial societies rely on each other economically.
      - In Military societies the state dominates over all organizations. Industrial societies have a very limited role played by the state.
      - **Characteristics of a Militant Society**
        - Entire structure of society is molded into military structure. Entire nation is a silent army. Defensive and offensive military action is predominant.
        - Military head is also the political head and has complete control over all his subjects.
        - Rigid hierarchy of power is throughout this society. Economic and material rewards are closely linked with social ranks, more power = richer.
        - Religious beliefs in this society also support the idea of a supreme authority. The religion itself is the same hierarchical organization as the society and the central Head of the society is also seen as the Ecclesastical(religous) Head.
        - Rigorous discipline is prevalent in all manners of life. State has full authority to interfere in lives of citizens. There are no individual rights and the state can not be questioned.
        - All members of the society are forced to cooperate (it is compulsory).
      - **Characteristics of An Industrial Society**
        - Each individual has personal rights and tried to maintain them.
        - Regulatory system is separate from the political system.
        - Free institutions are given security to grow without interference.
        - Less rigid class structure.
        - Less importance of religion and hierarchy
        - Individuals are the main concern of this society and the role of government is to ensure that the individual prospers.
        - The individual has the right to oppose an irresponsible government.
        - There is voluntary cooperation among citizens and they can interact using any contracts with each other as they wish.

  - Spencer also presented **Organic Analogy**. Where he considered the human society to be a single biological organism.
  - Following his organic analogy spencer considered various parts of society like state and economy to be like organs in the human body (heart/lungs/kidneys) which work interdependently and are necessary for the whole organism to function properly.
  - He further took ideas from biology and supported **Social Darwinism** which is basically Charles Darwin's theory of evolution from nature applied to sociology.
  - Social Darwinism is based on 2 principles:
    1. Survival of the Fittest:
      - Spencer believed that nature automatically eliminates the weak parts. He believed that the weak parts of the human society like poor people, disabled people, dumb / stupid people should not be supported and instead they should be left to die since they are less fit and it is natural for them to be eliminated so that the stronger parts of the human society survive and this will make the human society evolve into something stronger.
    2. Principle of Non-interference:
      - Spencer believed that the job of the state was to prevent any external entities from interfering the matters of its society.
      - He stated that the state should not waste money on education and taking care of the poor. Instead the state should target its resources into ensuring that rights of individuals are protected.
      - Spencer argued that no one should interfere in the natural process of selection in society and that nature is more intelligent than man.
      - His ideal society had individuals pursuing their interests without being hindered by the state in anyway.
      
## August Comte:
  - Introduced **Social Physics** to help solve and understand social problems.
  - Divided Science into **Theoretical Science** and **Applied Science**.
  - Believed that all sciences develop in **3 Stages**:
    1. **Theological** Stage where all phenomena is accepted as the result of supernatural or religious events. Everything from religion is accepted without any questioning or doubts.
    2. **Metaphysical** Stage is when people start to write down their observations and have discussions about why they may be happening. This is where books are written. This is mainly a transitional stage where people are moving towards scientific lines of questioning and moving away from theology and religious beliefs.
    3. **Positivism** Stage is the final stage at which actual scientific experimentation and observations with deduction, induction and measurement is done. In this stage nothing is believed without evidence by experimentation and observation. All claims go through verification until there is consensus.
  - Also presented **Static** and **Dynamic** Sociology. 
    - Static sociology deals with the study of a society which is in order. This order is the result of consensus and cohesiveness among all the elements of society which can include groups and institutions and organizations. Social structure is maintained.
    - Dynamic sociology is the study of social change. The natural condition of social change which is found in every society is called **evolution**. If it is according to people's will then it is called social progress. However, if social change is brought by force it is called a **revolution**. The change starts from the mind and ideas of individuals and results in changes in moral, political and economic structure of the society.

## Emile Durkheim:
  - Presented **Social Facts** as the main elements to be studied by sociology. He is considered to be the founder of **Structural Functionalism** which is a paradigm of studying sociology where the large scale view is considered instead of the individuals.
  - He defined social facts to be anything in society that puts external pressure on a member of society to act in a certain way. Examples of social facts can be culture, morals, traditions, norms, manners, guiding principles and beliefs.
  - **Collective Conscience** is ....
  - Also presented the theory of **Social Solidarity**. Social solidarity can be further divided into **Mechanical** and **Organic** solidarity.
    - Mechanical Solidarity is found in traditional and rural societies where everyone has very similar experiences. The members of society have similar economic status, similar beliefs, common values and culture. Such a society is very homogenous and its members have a high degree of solidarity or unity due to all the similarity. Collective Conscience is very strong in this society.
    - Organic Solidarity is found in urban societies where social change is very rapid. Customs and fashions are changing all the time. There is a very high degree of _Division of Labour_ and specialization so people have very different professions and experiences. Interactions in this society are very contractual and the feeling of mutual benefit is the main reason for any solidarity. Collective Conscience is very weak in this society.
  - This theory of social solidarity is similar to the Al-Asabiya presented by [Ibn-I-Khaldoon.](#ibn-i-khaldoon)
  - Also presented the **Theory of Suicide** where he described 3 types of suicide:
    1. **Egoistic Suicide** occurs when group solidarity grows weak. Typically seen in individuals who stop taking interest in matters of society or family and the society also stops taking interest in the matters of the individual. The individual feels isolated from society and considers life and death to be equal. This is a situation where social norms fail to put appropriate pressure on the members of society. Such suicide is found more in Organic societies than Mechanical societies.
    2. **Anomic Suicide** occurs when society undergoes rapid changes. This results in the norms and manners of society being broken and individuals are unable to adjust themselves which results in a normative gap. Social laws are considered weak in this situation since they fail to control the behavior of the individual. Society tends to fall into despair and there is uncertainty about the future. Lawlessness prevails, business slows down, projects get cancelled or postponed, marriages are postponed. Social norms are shattered. Disorganization is prevailent.
    3. **Altruisitc Suicide** occurs when the society has a very high degree of group solidarity. The people consider the interests of the group to have higher priority over the interests of the individual. An example would be the old people in northern cold regions of Tundra who kill themselves so that they would not be a burden on the limited resources of the society. In modern society soldiers who willingly register for war are committing Altruisitc suicide. In religion this idea of dying for the greater cause like **Jihad** in muslims is also found.
  - Considered religion to be the initial source of social solidarity and collective life. Described religion to act as a differentiating force between right and wrong. It allows man to separate sacred things from infance objects. Participation in Sacred ceremonies elevated the position of man in society. Without religion there would be no distinction of good and bad. Social and cultural norms would cease to exist.

## Max Weber
  - **Social Action**
