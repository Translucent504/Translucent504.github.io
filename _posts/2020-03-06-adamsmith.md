>Adam Smith: The other side of Communism?

<!--more-->

## Who is Adam Smith?
He is known as the **Father of Economics / Capitalism**. Also known for his book **Wealth of Nations** as the bible of Capitalism. 

## Working Notes:
Ideas influential:
  - writing during the industrial revolution
  - society changing rapidly (1770s)
  - very critical of the status quo and role of govt in economy (did not like regulation)
  - First scientific economist(?)
  - last economist philosopher
  - part of scottish enlightenment
  - gave birth to social science along with other scottish ppl.
Works:
  - Theory of moral sentiments:
    - 1759, very influential book
    - invited to france based on this strong work.
    - focused on moral psychology
    - how do people make judgements over day to day dealings.
    - bottom up approach.
  - Wealth of Nations:
    - feudalism is dying.
    - people are doing trade and manufacture.
    - how to deal with trade and manufacture?
    - status quo:
      - individuals work for the government
      - the government monitors / regulates all you do.
    - opposing theory from france
      - let things sort themselves out
      - it must be natural
      - agriculture is the main part of economics.
      - Adam smith likes the freedom element of this
      - Adam smith disagreed with agriculture being the centre.
      - Smith considered trade and manufacture to be the centre.
    - A commercial society is when every man is a merchant
      - Inorder to explain how this sort of society functions:
      - do not focus on the moral part of people doing it for the greater good of others or charity.
      - it is infact because they are working in their own self interests.
      - this order that arises from people working in their self interest 
      - this network of self interest and interdependence is *Invisible Hand*
      - Not the first idea of this kind: Fable of the bees
      - This sort of self interested society works only if the initial conditions are not corrupt.
      - David hugn? also part of scottish enlightenment.
    - Adam smith was not the father of modern day cut throat capitalism(?)
The Invisible Hand:
  - unintended consequences.
  - selfish and self interested is not the same (?)
  - Smith and Hugn : Good government is a condition for the invisible hand to actually work.
  - Smith himself also gives examples of malignant outcomes of the invisible hand.
