Random variables

Conditional Probability as a Random Variable

Independent Events

Zero Probability Events:

  $$P(E) == 0$$

- Not the same as impossible events.
- These are relevant when dealing with uncountable sets where every outcome by itself has 0 probability and even some events have 0 probability but are not impossible.Â For example consider the sample space to be the interval [0,1] and then consider the event that the outcome of our experiment is a rational number. Since the rationals are countable because they can be written as a *sequence.* We can consider the event that the outcome is rational to be a union of disjoint sets with a rational number in each set :

$$\cup_n w_i : w_i \epsilon Rationals $$
