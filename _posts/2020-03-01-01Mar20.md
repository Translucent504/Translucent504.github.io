> Fix Ubuntu not responding

<!--more-->

If our ubuntu desktop stops responding by not registering mouse clicks or keyboard shortcuts like `super` or `alt-tab` anymore but background processes keep running like music on chrome etc. Then do `Alt+PrntScrn` and type `R E I S U B`, `Alt+PrntScrn` seems to take a screenshot but it does bring the system back to life (!?).
