> Fix Ubuntu not responding, base 10 log in python

<!--more-->

If our ubuntu desktop stops responding by not registering mouse clicks or keyboard shortcuts like `super` or `alt-tab` anymore but background processes keep running like music on chrome etc. Then do `Alt+PrntScrn` and type `R E I S U B`, `Alt+PrntScrn` seems to take a screenshot but it does bring the system back to life (!?).

In python if we want to calculate the log base 10 of something we should use `math.log10(x)` instead of using `math.log(x, 10)`. This is because due to some rounding errors and whatnot `math.log(1000000, 10) = 5.9999999` instead of being in the range `6 -> 6.99999999`. Which I was expecting since for other inputs like `math.log(10000000, 10) = 7.0 and math.log(99999999, 10) = 7.99999`. The log base 10 seems to be within the floor which correspond to the number of digits in x but it failed. So using `math.log(1000000) = 6` correctly returns `6` instead of `5.999999`. This problem came up when working on [EPI 4.9 Is Number Palindrome]({% post_url 2020-03-01-epi49%}).
