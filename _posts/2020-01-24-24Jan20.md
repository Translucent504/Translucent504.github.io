Descriptive Statistics:
 - Categorical Variables (relative frequency / bar charts)

OpenNumbers / Gapminder data story telling. DDF / tidy data is a good thing.

Data visualization grammars used by ggplot2 or vegaidl or vizabi.

Good to encode the visualization of data into markers(circle/square/symbol) + attribute(length/color/size)

Found a book - Factfulness (Some good Global Facts of Human Progress)

regular expression for finding (PAK) or (AAA/PAK) from "blablabla (PAK)" 

```
(\([A-Z]+\))|(\([A-Z]+/[A-Z]+\))
```
