[What is Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQUAPiHahVY), Statistics basically grew out of probability theory which was used to help make decisions when outcomes were uncertain and we had a probabilistic model. Statistics was initially called **inverse-probability** since the idea was to figure out the underlying model from a set of observations / data.
