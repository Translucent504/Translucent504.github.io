> What is Statistics?, Basic Python.

<!--more-->

[What is Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQUAPiHahVY), Statistics basically grew out of probability theory which was used to help make decisions when outcomes were uncertain and we had a probabilistic model. Statistics was initially called **inverse-probability** since the idea was to figure out the underlying model from a set of observations / data. 

Studied the 'Effective Python' book's first few pages. Mostly learnt about using the walrus operator `:=` in cases where we are interested assigning a variable that is only relevant in a smaller scope like initializing a test variable outside an if statement makes it look as if the variable will be used elsewhere when in reality its only relevant inside the if statement. Some tips of when to use list comprehension and when to use generator expressions instead.
