<!--more-->

Introduction to Javascript:
- var uses functional scope (always bad)
- let uses block scope
- const disallows reassignment (preferred) (minimizes mutable states)

Declarative/Imperative Programming:
- Declarative : Describe what to accomplish not how like SQL. And also avoids side effects.
- Imperative : Describe details of control flow / algorithms. Procedural programming is a subset of Imperative.

Spatial Relations from Text:
- This is related to my project of physical visualizations from text.
- text2scene is what im trying to do.
