> Python arrays.

<!--more-->

Copying arrays can be 2 ways. Either a **shallow** copy or a **deep** copy. If we did `B = A` then `B` points to he same object as `A` and any changes in `A` will be seen in `B`. If we did `B = list(A)` then any changes in `A` will not be seen in `B`. Also if our array was a list of objects and we used `B = copy.copy(A)` then this creates a **shallow** copy. If the objects in `A` change their properties then objects in `B` will also reflect this change since they both refer to the same objects in memory. However, `B = copy.deepcopy(A)` completely duplicates all objects in `A` and if there is change in properties of objects in `A` they will not be reflected in `B`. Images make this distinction more clear.
