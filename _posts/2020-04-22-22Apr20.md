> Conditional Probability (Atlast)

<!--more-->

Finally got the basic intuition for conditional probabilities to click. All thanks to [Statlect](https://www.statlect.com/fundamentals-of-probability/conditional-probability) . The way to look at conditional probabilities it so simply consider them as subsetting our sample space. Consider 2 events: **E** and **I**. If I simply want to consider the probability of E then for a uniform probability law I would simply consider the cardinalities i.e 

$$
P(E) = \frac{card(E)}{card(\Omega)} \\ ..\\
P(I) = \frac{card(I)}{card(\Omega)}
$$

If I was then given some additional information that told me that the event I has occured and I wanted to know what is the probability that event E will occur. This means that I am now interested in the event E that is a subset of I. This is written as

$$
P(E|I)
$$

In terms of cardinalities we can interpret the probability of the event **E given I (E|I)** to be the elements of E that are in I divided by the total elements of I. We can then convert the  cardinalities to probabilities by dividing the numerator and denominator by the cardinality of the sample space

$$
P(E|I) = \frac{card(E\cap I)}{card(I)} \\. \\
P(E|I) = \frac{card(E\cap I)/card(\Omega)}{card(I)/card(\Omega)} \\ . \\
P(E|I) = \frac{P(E\cap I)}{P(I)}
$$
