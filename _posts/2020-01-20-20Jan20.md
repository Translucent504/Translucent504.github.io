- how to write a bash function which copies an md template renames it with the current date and opens it in vim.
- The jekyll theme minimal mistakes that I'm using determines the url of the post based on its filename ending. I had the following file name structure : YYYY-MM-DD-til.md for these posts and the parser was considering every post to have the name 'til'. the solution was to start naming the files as : YYYY-MM-DD-DDmmyy.md and now the parser correctly gives each post a unique url.
