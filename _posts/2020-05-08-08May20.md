>Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, SVD)

<!--more-->

Dimensionality reduction is basically a technique to convert our data to a lower dimensional form where we have non correlated variables that hopefully explain most of the variance in our data. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are just 2 methods of dimensionality reduction. [Associated Roam Page](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/eru504/page/NNavFesd5)
