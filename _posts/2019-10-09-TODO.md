## Algorithms
- [ ] Get familiarity with proofs ( induction and contradiction )
- [ ] Get familiarity with discrete probability.
   > This means that we need to do some Math for CS stuff.... probably only the	chapters on proofs and probability and can start reading CLRS then... an	d the algo specialization simultaneously..
- [ ] Start the Algorithms specialization on Coursera
