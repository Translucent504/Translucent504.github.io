<!--more-->

Learned how to do some basic powershell scripting. Setup and played around with different consoles/terminals on top of my powershell 7.0.0 shell. Tried out hyper and deleted it, didnt like it, didnt like the electron either. Playing around with ConEmu now, seems to be working fine so far. I was using marktext to edit my TIL files and it shows a bunch of deprecated electron errors to my terminal which I silenced by redirecting the output to "NUL". the current state of my powershell profile is this:

```powershell
function blog
{
    cd ~\repositories\translucent504.github.io
}

function til
{    
    $mark = "C:\Users\ERU\AppData\Local\Programs\Mark Text\Mark Text.exe"
    $date = get-date -f yyyy-MM-dd-ddMMMyy
    $filename = "C:\Users\ERU\repositories\translucent504.github.io\_posts\$date.md"
    if (!(test-path $filename))
    {
        cp 'C:\Users\ERU\repositories\translucent504.github.io\_posts\template.md' $filename
    }
    start $mark $filename -redirectstandardoutput "NUL"
}

function uptil
{
	blog
	git add .
	git commit -m "Updated TIL"
	git push
	cd -
}
```
