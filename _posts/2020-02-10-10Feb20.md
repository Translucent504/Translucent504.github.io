Embed pdf in github pages, Graphs, Spanning Trees, A\* Algorithms, Tree traversal using Stacks(NLR)

<!--more-->

You can embed pdf in github pages by using this code:

```

```

Graphs are a data structure with vertices and edges. Useful for representing stuff with connections like networks. They can be directed and undirected, dense or sparse. Can be represented with Adjacency list (good for sparse graphs since uses space proportional to connections) or Adjacency matrix (good for dense graphs since it uses a fixed amount of space regardless of edges).

Spanning trees are something used in networking to get rid of loops since they mess up the routing table due to same traffic coming from different sources... They are made by Prims and Kerusomething algorithm. Basically get rid of loops in graphs.

A\* Algorithm is for finding a path from single source to single target.
