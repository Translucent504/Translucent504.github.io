## **Problem**: 
Write a program that multiplies two nonnegative integers. The only operators allowed are:
  - Assignment
  - Bitwise operators `>> << | & ~ ^`
  - Equality checks and Boolean combinations
$$x>y$$ and increments are not allowed either.

## **Solution**:
The brute force approach would be to add $$x$$ to itself $$y$$ times. This can have time complexity of upto $$O(2^n)$$ where $$n$$ is the number of bits in input.

We can take advantage of the multiplication algorithm we normally use to calculate products manually where we multiply x by first digit of y and then shift x by a factor of 10 and add it to the result. We take this same approach with binary multiplication and instead of shifting by 10 we shift x one bit to the left i.e by a factor of 2. for example:
    - `1011` * `110` can be done by computing the sum of `1011`*`0` + `10110`*`1` + `101100`*`1`.
    - Here we add x shifted over by 1 bit to a running sum based on the bits in y. In other words we add $$2^k x$$ to the result if the $$k_th$$ bit of $$y$$ is 1.

Since we dont have arithmetic operations we have to implement our own `add` function and then implement `multiply` as follows:

```python
    
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Function to add 2 integers using binary operations only"""
    
    carry = 0
    result = 0
    # These will just act as counters
    tmp_a, tmp_b = (a, b)
    current_bit = 1
    while tmp_a or tmp_b:
        a_k = a & current_bit  # Extract kth bit of a
        b_k = b & current_bit  # Extract kth bit of b
        result |= a_k ^ b_k ^ carry
        carry = (a_k & b_k) | (a_k & carry) | (b_k & carry)
        carry, current_bit = (carry << 1, current_bit << 1)
        tmp_a, tmp_b = (tmp_a >> 1, tmp_b >> 1)
    return result | carry


def multiply(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Function to multiply 2 integers using binary operations only"""

    res = 0
    while y:
        if y & 1:
            res = add(res, x)
        x, y = x << 1, y >> 1
    return res

```
