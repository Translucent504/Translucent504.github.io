>Linear Programming
<!--more-->

Linear Programming is the study of optimization problems which can be expressed as linear functions along with some linear equations/inequalities as constraints.
 - There is this simplex algorithm which can be easily understood if you consider a linear programming problem with 2 variables and look at it geometrically, we can see that the optimal value is going to be at the vertex of the region that contains all **feasible solutions**. This region is called the simplex. CLRS has a very good and simple explanation of this in ch 29.
