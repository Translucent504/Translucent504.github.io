> R control structures, lexical scope, dates

<!--more-->

Basics of R just like any other programming language , has while , for, repeat loops for controlling flow. Its like python in determining scope in that it also uses **lexical scope**, where the function closure includes the environment at time of **function definition** as compared to **dynamic scope** which considers environment at **call / execution time**.

Dates count days/seconds from 1970-01-01 and time is in POSIXlt and POSIXct where POSIXlt has named attributes and POSIXct is just a large integer.
