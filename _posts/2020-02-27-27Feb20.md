<!--more-->

**Counting Number of set bits** can be done by either using the naive approach of simply bit shifting to the right by 1 and checking if the last bit is 1 or 0 or by using Peter Wegner's method of removing the lowest set bit on each loop iteration by using subtraction. The naive approach will have the number of iterations equal to the bit of the highest set bit in the integer like a 32 bit int with only the 32 bit = 1 will take 32 loop iterations, while the wegner's method has iterations equal to the number of set bits, it will take only 1 iteration for the 32 bit int with only the 32nd bit = 1.

```
def count_bits(x: int) -> int:
    """Naive Method"""
    num_bits = 0
    while x:
        num_bits += x & 1
        x >>= 1
    return num_bits


def count_bits(x: int) -> int:
    """Wegner's Method"""
    num_bits = 0
    while x:
        num_bits += 1
        x &= x - 1
    return num_bits
```
