## **Problem**: 
Write a program that takes a 64 bit unsigned integer and returns the 64 bit unsigned integer consisting of the bits of the input in reverse order. For example, if the input is `(1110000000000001)`, the output should be `(1000000000000111)`.

## **Solution**:
The naive solution will be to loop over the first half 32 bits and [Swap Bits](/epi42/) with the corresponding mirror bit in the other half. e.g: swap bit 0 with bit 63, swap bit 1 with 62 and so on...

Instead of this we can take advantage of caching and split our 64-bit into 4 16-bit numbers A, B, C, D. We also prepare a lookup table called **reversed** where the number at index i is the reversed version of i. example: 
  - `reversed[24] = 6144` because 
  - `bin(24) = 0000000000011000` and 
  - `bin(6144) = 0001100000000000`

So inorder to reverse our 64-bit integer which we can think of as **A-B-C-D** we need to form a new integer which looks like **reversed[D]-reversed[C]-reversed[B]-reversed[A]**. This can be very easily done by simply bit masking 16-bit portions and shifting them by a multiple of 16 and gluing them together with an **OR**. In code:

```python
import swap_bits

def reversed_table() -> list:
    """Function to produce a list containing all 16bit integers along
    with their reversed versions"""
    result = []
    for i in range(2**16 - 1):
        tmp = i
        for j in range(8):
            tmp = swap_bits.swap_bits(tmp, j, 15 - j)
        result.append(tmp)
    return result


def reverse_bits(x: int) -> int:
    """Function to reverse a 64 bit int assuming existence of a lookup table called reversed"""
    # The bit mask to extract 16 bits
    # 0xFFFF = 1111111111111111 in binary.
    reversed = reversed_table() 
    bit_mask = 0xFFFF
    mask_size = 16
    A = x >> mask_size * 3 & bit_mask
    B = x >> mask_size * 2 & bit_mask
    C = x >> mask_size & bit_mask
    D = x & bit_mask
    result = reversed[D] << mask_size * 3 \
        | reversed[C] << mask_size * 2 \
        | reversed[B] << mask_size \
        | reversed[A]
    return result
```

The separate assignments to variables A, B, C, D are done to improve readability. We couldve clumped everything inside the return statement.
