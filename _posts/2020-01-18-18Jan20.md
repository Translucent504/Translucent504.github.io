<!--more-->

- I have no clue how to implement conv1d... wtf is out_width / in_width and why are they not equal???? it makes sense for out channels to be different from in channels but wtf is up with widths?? isnt conv1d just supposed to sweep over the entire width???

- Can embed images in github like this 
  ```html

- Can make gif animations by making each frame with inkscape then combining..
- Apparently plank was no revolutionary, he was a [data fitterer](https://physicsworld.com/a/max-planck-the-reluctant-revolutionary) 
- Also learned how to install plugins in vim using vim-plug (just put "Plug 'name of plugin'" into the .vimrc file and done. 
- setup a markdown preview thing for vim so I can write to this file directly from the terminal.
- install from .deb file in ubuntu:
	```
	sudo dpkg -i /path/to/deb/file
	sudo apt-get install -f
	```
