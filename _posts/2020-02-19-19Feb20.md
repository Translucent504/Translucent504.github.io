<!--more-->

The main Duties of a data scientist are:
    1. Problem Definition  
        This consists of asking the right question. Most stakeholders do not know what they want. They want you to solve their problems with their Data. It is an important skill to understand how to formulate good Questions that can help in defining what problems we can solve with our data.
    2. Solution Measurement
        Once we have formulated a good question and we have used the data to come up with a model or a solution. We need a good metric to determine the quality or validity of our solution. This too is a difficult task. How do we really know how good our solution is? Sure we can model the data well and check our model's accuracy but the model isn't our solution. So we need to understand how to measure the actual quality of our solution.
