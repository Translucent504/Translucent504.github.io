# What is statistics, why study it?
>tree / map thing goes here?

The study of **organizing**, **analyzing**, **interpreting** and **presenting** data is statistics.

We can look at our data and ask a very long list of questions:
 - Where did this data come from?
 - How was it gathered?
 - What is the nature of this data?
 - How is this data distributed?
 - Do parts of this data have any correlations?
 - Are there any patterns?
 - Can we use this data to predict the future?
 - Can we use this data to predict the effect of changing a part of it?
 - How do we summarize this data?
 - ... and so on.

So its a good idea to divide such questions into broad categories:
 - **Sampling & Experiment Design**
 - **Descriptive Statistics**
 - **Inferential Statistics**

Our goal is to get a deep intuitive understanding of statistics that is sufficient to understand machine learning and data science. As far as I can tell machine learning is basically statistical inference. Data science however, seems to involve all of statistics from visualization and summarization to modelling, inference and analysis.

So where do we start and how do we structure this journey to statistical enlightenment. It seems logical to start with asking questions about the source of data and how it is gathered ( **Sampling & Experimentation** ). Then we can try to describe this data we have gathered, Think of useful ways to present it that makes it easier to find patterns and relations ( **Descriptive Statistics** ). Finally find the patterns and correlations in the Data and use it to make predictions ( **Inferential Statistics **).
