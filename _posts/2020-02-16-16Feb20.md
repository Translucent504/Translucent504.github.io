>ggplot2, fullwidth class, utility classes kramdown

<!--more-->
ggplot2 is a graphing package in R. The basic workflow of plotting is by using layers.`ggplot(data = mpg)` sets up an empty graph figure and gives it access to data inside *mpg*. `geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cty, y = class))` is then a separate layer that puts points in the figure/graph and maps the 2 properties of those points **x** and **y** to the variables **cty** and **class** which are both found in mpg. The amazing thing with ggplot is that we can map different attributes of our *aesthetic* to different variables in our *mpg dataframe*. Our aesthetic here is basically a point. we have mapped the x and y coordinates of that point already but points can also have other attributes like **shape**, **color**, **size**, **alpha** (which means opacity) etc. Any of these attributes could be mapped to variables in mpg like so: `geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cty, y = class, color = hwy, shape = displ))`. If we didnt want to map an attribute to a variable and just wanted to **Set** an attribute like fix the color of all points to something then we would set it outside the *aes()* mapping like `geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cty, y = class), color = "red")`. We basically add these layers on top of each other like:  
{: .text-justify}

```
ggplot(data = mpg) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cty, y = class))
```

A **geom** is the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent observations. People often describe plots by the type of geom that the plot uses. For example, bar charts use bar geoms, line charts use line geoms, boxplots use boxplot geoms, and so on. Scatterplots break the trend; they use the point geom.

<style>
.full-width {
	left: 50%;
	margin-left: -50vw;
	margin-right: -50vw;
	max-width: 99vw;
	position: relative;
	right: 50%;
	width: 99vw;
}
</style>
<div class="full-width">

</div>

Inorder to display full width content like the above pdf that breaks out of its parent container we use this [full-width utility class](https://twitter.com/una/status/951519740840873984) Which I just threw inside style tags within this markdown file:  

```
.full-width {
	left: 50%;
	margin-left: -50vw;
	margin-right: -50vw;
	max-width: 100vw;
	position: relative;
	right: 50%;
	width: 100vw;
}
```

Also inorder to add classes to blocks within markdown, since we are using kramdown we can add this at the bottom of textblock:  

```
{: text-justify}
```

Which is just a utility class which justifies the text, for more info read [this link](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html#block-attributes).
