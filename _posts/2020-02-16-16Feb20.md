<!--more-->

ggplot2 is a graphing package in R. The basic workflow of plotting is by using layers.`ggplot(data = mpg)` sets up an empty graph figure and gives it access to data inside *mpg*. `geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cty, y = class))` is then a separate layer that puts points in the figure/graph and maps the 2 properties of those points **x** and **y** to the variables **cty** and **class** which are both found in mpg. The amazing thing with ggplot is that we can map different attributes of our *aesthetic* to different variables in our *mpg dataframe*. Our aesthetic here is basically a point. we have mapped the x and y coordinates of that point already but points can also have other attributes like **shape**, **color**, **size**, **alpha** (which means opacity) etc. Any of these attributes could be mapped to variables in mpg like so: `geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cty, y = class, color = hwy, shape = displ))`. If we didnt want to map an attribute to a variable and just wanted to **Set** an attribute like fix the color of all points to something then we would set it outside the *aes()* mapping like `geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cty, y = class), color = "red")`. We basically add these layers on top of each other like:  

```
ggplot(data = mpg) +
    geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cty, y = class))
```
