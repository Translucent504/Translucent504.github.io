> R Simulation and Profiling

<!--more-->

We can simulate random distributions and sampling in R by using:
- rnorm, pnorm, qnorm, dnorm.
- rpois, ppois, qpois, dpois.
- rbinom, pbinom, qbinom, dbinom
- and so on ....

The ones with prefix r like `rnorm, rpois, rbinom` are used as random number generators which sample from their respective distributions. We also have a `sample` function which allows us to sample from our own probability distributions or vectors.

The R profiler `Rprof()` and `system.time()` are useful tools to help optimize our code since they let us see where the bottlenecks are. `system.time()` is useful when we actually know what is causing the bottleneck so we can look at how long its execution takes (`user, elapsed times`). The profiler actually looks at the function call stack and tells us how long we are spending in which calls. It has `by.total` and `by.self`. by self is better since by.total gives 100pc for all top level functions.
