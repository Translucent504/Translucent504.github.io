<!--more-->

- To set a keyboard shortcut to a script in ubuntu, save the script with chmod +x in some place thats included in PATH (usually ~/bin/) and add this to the keyboard shortcut command field:
	```
	gnome-terminal -e <script.sh>
	```
- introduction to RNN, basic neural net with some sort of memory or consideration of a series of inputs. some idea of finite response models (partially recurrent) and state space models and the idea of back propagation through time.
- recall/precision as error metrics for skewed classes and using them together as F score.
- a little bit of geometric interpretation of vectors in context of applied multivariate statistics.
- little bit of beautifulsoup4, its an easy way to parse entire html pages that you get with requests in python.

	```python
	soup = bs4(url, "html.parser")
	soup.find("a") => returns a tag
	```
