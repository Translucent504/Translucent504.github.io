## **Problem**: 
Implement a function that returns a random integer between $$a$$ and $$b$$ inclusive with equal probability. You are given a function that generates a `1` or a `0` randomly. 

## **Solution**:
We can use the random number generator provided to us to generate bits randomly. We can keep generating a random bit and then shifting it and storing it in a result variable until we have the desired number of bits which will be the same as the number of bits necessary to represent our range.

**Example**:
$$
a = 3 \\ 
b = 24 \\
result = 0 \\
i = 0
$$
The number of bits needed to represent this range `24-3 = 21` is `5`. So we run a loop with 5 iterations and in each iteration we generate a random bit for our result.
  1. Generate random number. `result = result | (random_number << i)`. `i = i + 1`.
  2. Generate random number. `result = result | (random_number << i)`. `i = i + 1`.
Keep Repeating until we have a result. Check if that result is in the range i.e `result <= 21` if yes then shift the result into our range by adding the lower bound $$a$$ to our result: `result = result + a` and that is our answer. Otherwise if result is not in the range then we just run the whole loop again.

In code. Note that zero_one_random() is a provided function that generates a random number from `0, 1`:

```python
def uniform_random(lower_bound: int, upper_bound: int) -> int:
    """Generate random int in given range"""
    r = upper_bound - lower_bound
    while True:
        result = 0
        current_bit = 0
        while True:
            result = result | (zero_one_random() << current_bit)
            r >>= 1
            if not r:
                break
            current_bit += 1
        r = upper_bound - lower_bound
        if result <= r:
            return result + lower_bound
```
